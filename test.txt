----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As a registered user, 
I want to authenticate into the system using my username and password 
so that I can securely access my personal account and its features.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a registered user enters a valid username and password and clicks the "Login" button, they are redirected to their account dashboard within 2 seconds.
Given a user enters an incorrect username or password and clicks the "Login" button, an error message displays stating, "Invalid credentials, please try again."
Given a user submits valid credentials, the system verifies them against the database and grants access only if they match.
The login process must complete in under 3 seconds under normal system load.
